    "**Title: Apache Cassandra Data Modeling and Queries Presentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "- In this project, we aimed to model data for Apache Cassandra and execute queries to derive meaningful insights from our music app history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ETL Pipeline for Pre-Processing:**\n",
    "- We initiated the project by implementing the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline.\n",
    "- Original event data CSV files were processed, and a new CSV file ('event_datafile_new.csv') was created for Apache Cassandra tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Modeling:**\n",
    "- Our data is denormalized in 'event_datafile_new.csv' to efficiently support the required queries.\n",
    "- Visual representation of the denormalized data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query 1: Retrieve Specific Session Information**\n",
    "   - **Description:** We aimed to retrieve the artist, song title, and song's length for sessionId = 338 and itemInSession = 4.\n",
    "   - **Table Created:** `session_songs`\n",
    "   - **Primary Key:** `(sessionId, itemInSession)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query 2: User and Song Information for a Session**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Our goal was to obtain the artist, song (sorted by itemInSession), and user (first and last name) for userid = 10 and sessionid = 182.\n",
    "   - **Table Created:** `event_log`\n",
    "   - **Primary Key:** `((user_id, session_id), item_in_session)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query 3: Users Who Listened to a Specific Song**\n",
    "   - **Description:** We sought to retrieve every user name (first and last) who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own.'\n",
    "   - **Table Created:** `song_users`\n",
    "   - **Primary Key:** `(song, user_id)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Implementation:**\n",
    "- Our code is organized and modular for each query, ensuring readability and maintainability.\n",
    "- Unnecessary in-line comments related to project instructions have been removed for a polished and professional appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Insertion and Verification:**\n",
    "- Demonstrated how data is inserted into the tables for each query.\n",
    "- Verified data insertion with SELECT statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges and Learnings:**\n",
    "- Briefly discussed challenges encountered during the project.\n",
    "- Highlighted key learnings and insights gained from the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "- Summarized the success criteria of the project.\n",
    "- Emphasized the significance of Apache Cassandra data modeling for efficient querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Cleanliness:**\n",
    "- The code is clean, modular, and professionally formatted for better understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Improvements:**\n",
    "- Provided suggestions for potential improvements or optimizations in the data modeling and querying process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**References:**\n",
    "- No external sources were used in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This presentation structure provides a comprehensive overview of the project, covering key aspects and ensuring a professional presentation of the work done."
